# Gem Variety (Unnamed) 

### Minecraft Mod - Adds distinct gems balanced around Diamond and Netherite to add variety and give players more choice as well as making exploring the Nether and End more worthwhile.

# Dev Note:
As I'm not yet creating a release I'm not publishing more information as I'm likely to change most things. I'm still not sure where I want to take this, but I'm using this project to explore Forge. I anticipated great difficulty with poorly documented and obfuscated code, but so far my experiences have been positive despite the occasional hiccup. Using Forge is much easier than I expected. It's easy enough to be fun, and that's what makes game modding fun or so I'm told. Hopefully I can make something interesting of this. :)
